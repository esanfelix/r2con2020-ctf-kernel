# Kernel pwnable for r2con 2019 CTF 

This repository contains the challenge I contributed the r2con 2020 CTF. This 
challenge is based on [last year's challenge](https://github.com/esanfelix/r2con2019-ctf-kernel) 
and was only solved once during the CTF.

The repository contains the following folders:

* `challenge/` contains the files provided to the CTF participants.

* `source/`: contains the source code of the `socks_v2.ko` module running in the 
challenge VM.

* `solution/`: will contain a short write-up of my solution and my exploit code 
in a few days.
